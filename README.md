# sukku-bot

Working on a friendly, self-reflective chat bot based on an LLM (Large Language Model) architecture. Leveraging natural language understanding (NLU), the bot encourages users to explore their thoughts and emotions, guiding them toward personal insights and self-discovery. The project emphasizes prompt engineering and machine learning for now.

This is version 1

It's a work in progress, I have other ideas to implement on this and more skills to learn on the way!
