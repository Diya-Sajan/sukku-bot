# Sukku-bot

I'm working on a self-reflection chatbot that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) and Langchain for contextual memory. By leveraging natural language understanding (NLU), the bot aims to create a supportive space for users to explore their thoughts and emotions, ultimately fostering self-discovery. This project focuses on prompt engineering to guide user conversations and incorporates machine learning for response generation. Using Streamlit, the chatbot provides a seamless and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

This is version 1

It's a work in progress, I have other ideas to implement on this and more skills to learn on the way!

## Sukku - Self-Reflection Chatbot with Contextual Memory (using Langchain and Streamlit)

### Description:
This project builds a self-reflection chatbot that leverages Langchain and Streamlit. The bot aims to simulate a supportive friend by actively listening to the user and providing prompts and questions to encourage self-reflection. 

### Key features include:

* **Contextual Awareness**: The bot utilizes a conversation memory window (powered by Langchain) to access and analyze the most recent user interactions. This allows the bot to generate responses that are relevant to the ongoing conversation flow.
* **Kind and Supportive Tone**: The prompts and questions are designed to be empathetic and encouraging, fostering a safe space for self-exploration.
* **Streamlit Interface**: The chatbot is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for text-based interaction.

### Technologies Used:
* Langchain (for conversation memory and LLM integration)
* Streamlit (for web app development)
* ChatGoogleGenerativeAI (or your chosen LLM)
